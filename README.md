- `pyenv`: a tool to manage multiple Python versions.

In here, we use `3.8.10` version.

#### Installing pyenv

xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git

# Install pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Add pyenv to $PATH by adding the following lines to your profile or shell configuration file, for example ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

```bash
